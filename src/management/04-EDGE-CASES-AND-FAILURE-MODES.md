# Edge Cases & Failure Modes

## Overview

This document describes known edge cases in user interaction, failure scenarios, and how the application currently handles them (or should handle them going forward).

---

## Quiz Flow Edge Cases

### 1. Empty Question Set

**Scenario:** User navigates to a quiz for a unit with no questions.

**Current Behavior:**
- Quiz shows loading state indefinitely
- No error message displayed

**Recommended Fix:**
- Check if `questions.length === 0` after loading
- Display "No questions available for this unit" message
- Provide navigation back to unit selection

---

### 2. User Skips Questions

**Scenario:** User uses Skip button during a quiz.

**Current Behavior:**
- Skipped questions are marked as incorrect with `skipped: true`
- User continues to next unanswered question
- When all unanswered questions are done, a **transition screen** appears
- User can choose to review skipped questions or go directly to results
- If reviewing: skipped questions are presented one by one
- If user skips again during review: question is marked as `SKIPPED_FINAL` (no more revisits)
- Progress display shows "Skipped Question X of Y" during review section

**Handling:** Working as designed with full user control.

---

### 3. User Skips All Questions Then Spam-Skips in Review

**Scenario:** User skips all questions, chooses to review, then keeps pressing skip.

**Current Behavior:**
- Each skip in review section marks question as `SKIPPED_FINAL`
- Questions marked `SKIPPED_FINAL` cannot be revisited
- After all skipped questions are finalized, quiz ends and goes to results
- No infinite loops possible

**Handling:** Working as designed. Users can skip through review quickly if desired.

---

### 4. Browser Refresh During Quiz

**Scenario:** User refreshes page mid-quiz.

**Current Behavior:**
- Quiz progress is **preserved** via localStorage
- Timer state is restored
- Questions remain in same order
- User continues from where they left off

**Technical Details:**
- State saved to `in-progress-quiz-v1` key
- Keyed by route: `{subject}|{unitId}|{quizType}`
- Includes: questions, attempts, currentIndex, timer, etc.

**Handling:** Working as designed via `inProgressQuizStorage.ts`.

---

### 5. Starting New Quiz When Progress Exists

**Scenario:** User has saved progress but explicitly starts a new attempt.

**Current Behavior:**
- If navigating with `startNewAttempt: true` in location state, old progress is cleared
- Fresh quiz starts with reshuffled questions
- Timer resets to zero

**Handling:** Working as designed.

---

### 6. Network Failure Loading Images

**Scenario:** Question images fail to load.

**Current Behavior:**
- Broken image icon displayed
- Question still answerable (if text is sufficient)

**Recommended Handling:**
- Add `onError` handler to show placeholder
- Consider preloading images before quiz starts

---

### 7. Very Long Free Response Answers

**Scenario:** User types extremely long answer in free response.

**Current Behavior:**
- No character limit
- Long text may overflow in results display

**Recommended Limit:** Consider 2000 character max.

---

### 8. Special Characters in Answers

**Scenario:** User includes special characters, emojis, or Unicode.

**Current Behavior:**
- Stored and displayed as-is
- No sanitization

**Security Note:** Since answers are only stored in localStorage and displayed back to the user, XSS is not a concern.

---

## Preset Edge Cases

### 1. Preset References Deleted Questions

**Scenario:** Preset contains questionIds that no longer exist in the question bank.

**Current Behavior (when loading preset):**
- Missing questions are silently skipped
- If ALL questions are missing, quiz starts with empty set

**Recommended Enhancement:**
- Show warning: "X of Y questions no longer exist"
- Offer to update the preset

---

### 2. Preset Import Validation

**Scenario:** User imports a preset JSON file.

**Current Behavior:**
- Validates all questionIds exist in current dataset
- Shows specific error if none exist
- Shows specific error if some are missing

**Handling:** Working as designed with clear error messages.

---

### 3. Duplicate Preset Names

**Scenario:** User creates two presets with the same name.

**Current Behavior:**
- Allowed (IDs are unique, names are not)
- Could confuse users

**Recommended:** Add warning but allow duplicates (user might want "Version 1", "Version 2").

---

### 4. Downloading Wrong Answers as Preset

**Scenario:** User downloads wrong answers from results page.

**Current Behavior:**
- Dialog appears allowing user to customize preset name
- Default name: "Wrong Answers - {subject} {unitId}"
- User can edit before download
- File name is sanitized from preset name
- JSON file downloaded with version and preset data

**Handling:** Working as designed with customization.

---

## Custom Units Edge Cases

### 1. Importing Malformed .ts File

**Scenario:** User uploads a .ts file that doesn't match expected format.

**Current Behavior:**
- `parseTopicFile()` returns null
- Toast error: "Failed to parse topic file"

**Handling:** Working as designed.

---

### 2. Importing ZIP with MCQ Questions

**Scenario:** User imports a ZIP file containing multiple-choice questions.

**Current Behavior:**
- Parser handles both JSON-stringified and TypeScript literal syntax for options
- MCQ options are correctly restored with label, value, text, and image
- Images in options are converted to base64 for localStorage storage

**Handling:** Working as designed with robust parsing.

---

### 3. Very Large Custom Topic

**Scenario:** User creates topic with hundreds of questions.

**Current Behavior:**
- Works but may hit localStorage limits (~5-10MB total)
- No warning when approaching limits

**Recommended:**
- Track storage usage
- Warn when > 80% capacity
- Suggest exporting and clearing old data

---

### 4. Images in Custom Topics

**Scenario:** User adds questions with embedded base64 images.

**Current Behavior:**
- Images stored as base64 data URLs in localStorage
- Dramatically increases storage usage
- Can quickly hit storage limits
- When exporting: images extracted to public/images/ folder
- MCQ option images also extracted with naming: `{topic}-q{N}-opt{M}.png`

**Recommended:**
- Warn about storage impact
- Consider image compression
- Offer cloud storage alternative

---

### 5. Deleting Unit with Active Quiz

**Scenario:** User deletes a custom unit while a quiz from that unit is in progress.

**Current Behavior:**
- Quiz continues (questions already loaded in memory)
- Results can be saved
- Wrong answers reference non-existent unit

**Note:** Edge case unlikely in practice.

---

## Results Page Edge Cases

### 1. Direct Navigation to Results

**Scenario:** User directly navigates to `/results` without completing a quiz.

**Current Behavior:**
- Redirects to home (`navigate('/')`)
- No error shown

**Handling:** Working as designed.

---

### 2. Results with Zero Questions

**Scenario:** Quiz completed with no questions (empty quiz).

**Current Behavior:**
- Division by zero in percentage calculation
- Shows "NaN%" or crashes

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
const percentage = total > 0 ? Math.round((score / total) * 100) : 0;
```

---

## Navigation Edge Cases

### 1. Invalid Route Parameters

**Scenario:** User navigates to `/unit/fakesub/fakeunit`

**Current Behavior:**
- Page loads but with no questions
- Shows empty state

**Recommended:**
- Check if subject/unit exists
- Show 404 or redirect to category

---

### 2. Back Button After Quiz Complete

**Scenario:** User presses browser back after seeing results.

**Current Behavior:**
- Returns to previous page
- If that was the quiz, may show empty/broken state

**Handling:** Consider using `replace` instead of `navigate` for results redirect.

---

## Performance Edge Cases

### 1. Very Large Question Bank

**Scenario:** A single topic has 500+ questions.

**Current Behavior:**
- All questions loaded into memory
- Shuffling is O(n) but fast
- "View All Questions" renders all at once

**Recommended:**
- Add pagination to "View All Questions"
- Consider lazy loading for very large sets

---

### 2. Many Imported Question Sets

**Scenario:** User imports 20+ question sets into Course Challenge.

**Current Behavior:**
- All loaded on page mount
- May cause slow initial load

**Recommended:** Lazy load imported sets.

---

## Data Corruption Scenarios

### 1. LocalStorage Manually Edited

**Scenario:** User or browser extension modifies localStorage.

**Current Behavior:**
- JSON.parse may throw
- Caught in try/catch, defaults to empty state
- Console error logged

**Handling:** Graceful degradation works.

---

### 2. Storage Quota Exceeded

**Scenario:** localStorage is full.

**Current Behavior:**
- `setItem` throws QuotaExceededError
- Not caught in current code
- Subsequent saves fail silently

**Recommended Fix:**
```typescript
try {
  localStorage.setItem(key, value);
} catch (e) {
  if (e.name === 'QuotaExceededError') {
    toast.error('Storage full. Please export and clear some data.');
  }
}
```

---

### 3. Concurrent Tab Updates

**Scenario:** User has app open in two tabs, makes changes in both.

**Current Behavior:**
- Each tab has its own React state
- Both write to same localStorage keys
- Last write wins
- No conflict resolution

**Mitigation:** Accept this limitation. Users rarely use multiple tabs.

---

## How to Handle Issues Going Forward

### General Principles

1. **Fail gracefully:** Always catch errors and provide fallback behavior
2. **Inform the user:** Show clear error messages, not silent failures
3. **Preserve data:** Never delete user data without explicit confirmation
4. **Log for debugging:** Console.log errors with context

### Adding New Features

When adding features, consider:
- What if the data doesn't exist yet?
- What if the data is malformed?
- What if the user cancels mid-action?
- What if localStorage is full?
- What if the network is down?

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with empty data
- [ ] Test with maximum data (fill localStorage)
- [ ] Test with invalid data (manually corrupt localStorage)
- [ ] Test browser refresh at each step
- [ ] Test in private/incognito mode
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test skip functionality (skip all, skip in review, etc.)
- [ ] Test quiz resume after refresh
